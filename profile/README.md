# Welcome to Our Repository... Dead Ass üëÄ

## Who We Are :accessibility: :
We are **Pubest** and **Phanudet**, two **CPE students** from **Chiang Mai University (CMU)**, out here tryna code like it's a full-time job (but really, it‚Äôs just school and the occasional nap). Our code? Might break. Our memes? On point. üòé

We‚Äôre just two students who discovered the beauty of **debugging** at 2 AM and realized we might need a bit more caffeine in our lives. If you see us online at ungodly hours, don't worry, we‚Äôre just out here making cool stuff (and low-key praying it works).

## Our Tech Stacküíª:
We live in the code jungle, swinging between languages and tools, just trying not to fall into the void. Here‚Äôs the stack that fuels the late-night grind:

## Interested Technologies üîç

We also found some other shiny new toys we‚Äôre *low-key* obsessed with:

![Bun](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bun-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=bun&logoColor=white)
![Golang](https://img.shields.io/badge/Golang-00ADD8?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)

We're out here trying to understand them and figure out if they actually work or if we‚Äôre just vibing. üòÖ
